<div class="text-left mt-5">
    <h2> Instructions</h2>
    <p> In this study, you will be presented with a series of first-person images. You may or may not be presented with
        a list of activities or objects to choose from on the right hand side of the page. Your task is to choose the
        best description of activities being performed
        by the camera wearer in the image. If the presented list of activities or objects does not contain the activity
        or object you want to describe, please
        use the "other" text box to type in your answer.
    </p>
    <p>Below are some examples snippets of annotations performed.</p>

    <h3 class="mb-3 mt-5">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <p> <strong>What if the activity is not clear in the picture?
        </strong><br>
        We ask you to choose the best description of the activity being performed in the image. If you are not sure,
        please put your best guess in the text box or choose the best answer from the suggestion list on the right
        side
        of the page.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Some of the suggestions provided are nouns or names of objects rather than activities. Do I select
            nouns?</strong><br>
        We ask you to choose the best description of the activity being performed in the image. If the suggested
        list
        are nouns,
        please do your best to find an activity that represents the image or type in the text box to write the
        activity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The options listed basically mean the same thing. Is it okay if I choose any of the options?</strong>
        Yes.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Can I ask questions in the middle of the study?</strong>
    Yes. However, we can not do the annotation or give you the "correct annotation" for you.</p>

    <h2>NASA Task Load Index (TLX) Survey</h2>
    <p> You will be asked to take part in a phone based survey which is designed to assess the workload you experienced
        while performing
        the annotation you perform. There are 6 sources of workload that will be presented to you, namely;
        <strong>Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort, and Frustration Level</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Mental Demand: </strong> How much mental and perceptual activity was required (for example, thinking, deciding, calculating, remembering, looking, searching, etc.)?
        Was the task easy or demanding, simple or complex, exacting or forgiving?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Physical Demand: </strong> How much physical activity was required (for example, pushing, pulling, turning, controlling, activating, etc.)?
        Was the task easy or demanding, slow or brisk, slack or strenuous, restful or laborious?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Temporal Demand: </strong> How much time pressure did you feel due to the rate or pace at which the tasks or task elements occurred?
        Was the pace slow and leisurely or rapid and frantic?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Performance: </strong> How successful do you think you were in accomplishing the goals of the task set by the experimenter?
        How satisfied were you with your performance in accomplishing these goals?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Effort: </strong> How hard did you have to work (mentally and physically) to accomplish your level of performance?
        How much mental and physical activity was required (such as thinking, deciding, calculating, remembering, looking, searching, etc.)?
        Was the task easy or demanding, simple or complex, exacting or forgiving?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Frustration Level: </strong> How insecure, discouraged, irritated, stressed, and annoyed versus secure, gratified, content, relaxed, and complacent did you feel during the task?
    </p>
    <p>
        First, the phone app will ask you pick one factor out of a pair of factors that was more important
        contributor for your workload. This is used to weight your responses to each of the workload factors. Then, you will score each 
        of the sources of workload on a scale of 100 on the official NASA TLX phone application.

        You will get a chance to review this again later.

    <h2>Open Ended Survey</h2>
    <p> At the end of the study, we will give you opportunity to provide any comments about your experience in making
        annotations to the images. We will make notes
        about your comments.
